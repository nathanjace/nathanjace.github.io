An Apache HTTP Server, often referred to simply as Apache, is one of the most widely used web server software in the world. It is an open-source web server designed to serve web content securely, efficiently, and reliably. Apache provides a robust and flexible platform for hosting websites, web applications, and various services. We will explore how to set up and configure Apache to meet your specific hosting needs.
# Oracle Cloud
Oracle Cloud is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offered by Oracle Corporation. It provides a wide range of cloud services, including computing, storage, database, networking, and more. Oracle Cloud is known for its high performance, scalability, and security, making it an excellent choice for hosting web applications and websites. We will guide you through the process of setting up an Oracle Cloud instance, ensuring a stable and secure environment for your Apache Server.

A custom domain is a crucial element for any online presence. It allows you to personalize your website's URL to reflect your brand or content. By using a custom domain, you can establish a professional and memorable web address that aligns with your objectives. We will show you how to acquire and configure a custom domain to make your Apache Server easily accessible under your chosen web address. We will be using an open source project called duckdns.
